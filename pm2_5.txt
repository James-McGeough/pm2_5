Do one for HK:

http://www.aqhi.gov.hk/en/annual-aqi/latest-annual-aqi.html
http://aqicn.org/city/hongkong/




could have geographic averages (maybe averages per province)

graphs per city

main site - most populous cities
	-regional capitals?
	- worst? best? 10





think about how many times you have to calculate certain things (e.g. for provinces, you could have a 
dictionary stored that lists which city is where - don't need to find this every time)



all you need to update is the pm2.5 levels - how often to update?
